        Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Sujith Kumar R and I am a
        fresh graduate with a passion for software development. Throughout my
        time in college, I have gained a strong foundation in programming
        concepts and technologies such as JavaScript, React Js and MERN Stack.
        My portfolio showcases a variety of projects that demonstrate my
        technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and attention to detail. I
        am excited to continue to learn and grow as a developer, and I am eager
        to bring my passion and skills to a dynamic team. Thank you for taking
        the time to review my portfolio, and I look forward to the opportunity
        to connect with you soon.
